Background:
===========

An exchange feed for a given financial instrument (stock, future, option,
etc.) is a sequence of messages describing two distinct objects: orders and
trades. Orders are offers by market participants to buy (sell) up to a given
quantity at or below (above) a specified price. Generally there are a number
of orders to buy at low prices, and a number of orders to sell at high prices,
since everybody is trying to get a good deal. If at any point the exchange has
a buy order and a sell order at the same price, the two orders are 'matched'
with each other, producing a trade for the smaller of the two order
quantities.

If there are multiple orders that could be matched against each other, the
orders are matched first to the best possible price (i.e., the lowest-price
sell or the highest-price buy order). In the (very common) event of a tie,
orders are matched in time priority (first order to arrive will be filled
first). For example, if the standing orders are

price orders (oldest to newest, B = buy, S = sell)
1100
1075 S 1 // one order to sell up to 1 at 1075
1050 S 10 // one order to sell up to 10 at 1050
1025 S 2 S 5 // one order to sell up to 2 at 1025,
// and second newer order to sell up to 5

1000 B 9 B 1 // buy up to 9 at 1000, second to buy up to 1
975 B 30 // buy up to 30 at 975
950

the best buy order is at a price of 1000, and the best sell order is at a
price of 1025. Since no seller is willing to sell low enough to match a buyer,
and no buyer is willing to buy high enough to match a seller, there is no
match between any of the existing orders.

If a new buy order arrives for a quantity of 3 at a price of 1050, there will
be a match. The only sells that are willing to sell at or below a price of
1050 are the S10, the S2, and the S5. Since the S2 and S5 are at a better
price, the new order will match first against those. Since the S2 arrived
first, the new order will match against the full S2 and produce a trade of
2. However, the 1 remaining quantity will still match the S5, so it matches
and produces a trade of 1, and the S5 becomes an S4. Two trade messages will
be generated when this happens, indicating a trade of size 2 at price 1025,
and a trade of size 1 at price 1025. Two order-related messages will also be
generated: one to remove the S2, and one to note the modification of the S5
down to an S4. The new set of standing orders will be:

price orders
1100
1075 S 1 
1050 S 10 
1025 S 4

1000 B 9 B 1 
975 B 30 
950

Note that if a new sell order arrives at a price of 1025, it will be placed to
the right of the S4 (i.e., behind it in the queue). Also, although there are
only a few price levels shown here, you should bear in mind that buys and
sells can arrive at any price level.

Messages:
=========

The types of messages that can arrive on the exchange feed are as follows:

Order: action,orderid,side,quantity,price (e.g., A,123,B,9,1000)
action = A (add), X (remove), M (modify)
orderid = unique positive integer to identify each order;
used to reference existing orders for remove/modify
side = B (buy), S (sell)
quantity = positive integer indicating maximum quantity to buy/sell
price = double indicating max price at which to buy/min price to sell

Trade: action,quantity,price (e.g., T,2,1025)
action = T (trade)
quantity = amount that traded
price = price at which the trade happened

Example:
========

The following set of messages builds the initial book from the example in the
Background section above. Note that order 100004 is canceled, so it doesn't
appear in the book above.

A,100000,S,1,1075
A,100001,B,9,1000
A,100002,B,30,975
A,100003,S,10,1050
A,100004,B,10,950
A,100005,S,2,1025
A,100006,B,1,1000
X,100004,B,10,950 // cancel
A,100007,S,5,1025

The following sequence of additional messages represents the new order and
subsequent trades, removes, and modifies that happens in the second part of
the Background example above:

A,100008,B,3,1050
T,2,1025
T,1,1025
X,100008,B,3,1050
X,100005,S,2,1025
M,100007,S,4,1025 // order is modified down to reflect quantity traded

The state of the book after these messages is shown at the end of the
Background section.

Problem:
========

(1) Given a sequence of messages, as defined above, construct an in-memory
representation of the current state of the order book. You will need to
generate your own dataset to test your code.

(2) Write out a human-readable representation of the book every 10th message.

(3) Write out a machine-readable sequence of 'midquotes' (average of best buy
and best sell order prices) on every message. For example, the correct
sequence of midquotes for the messages given in the first part of the Example
above is

NAN // no buys yet, so midquote is undefined
1037.5 // = (1075. + 1000.)/2.0
1037.5 // new buy at 975 is lower than best, so midquote doesn't change
1025 // = (1050. + 1000.)/2.0 (new sell is at a better price than old)
1025 // new buy at 950 is lower than best, so midquote doesn't change
1012.5 // = (1025. + 1000.)/2.0 (new sell is again lower than best)
1012.5 // new buy at 1000 changes quantity, but not midquote
1012.5 // cancel of old buy at 950 (less than best) doesn't change midquote
1012.5 // new sell at 1025 adds to quantity, but again doesn't change best

(4) Write out the total quantity traded at the most recent trade price on
every trade message. For example

message => output
T,2,1025 => 2@1025
T,1,1025 => 3@1025
T,1,1000 => 1@1000 // quantity resets when new trade price is seen
T,1,1025 => 1@1025 // doesn't remember the previous trades @1025

(5) Your code should be clean, easy to understand, efficient, and
robust. Specifically, your program should not crash if it gets:

a. corrupted messages
b. duplicated order ids (duplicate adds)
c. trades with no corresponding order
d. removes with no corresponding order
e. best sell order price at or below best buy order price,
but no trades occur
f. negative, missing, or out-of-bounds prices, quantities, order ids

You should note how often each of these cases occurs and print a summary when
the program finishes processing all messages.

(6) The following is a stub C++ program to get you started. Feel free to
modify it as you see fit. You may use STL.
